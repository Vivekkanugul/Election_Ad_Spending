**Election Ad Spending Analysis (India 2024)**

Analyzing how political campaigns leveraged Meta's Facebook & Instagram ad platforms during the Indian General Elections 2024 to understand the relationship between campaign spending and voter behavior.

**Overview**

During the election season, social media platforms became battlegrounds, with political parties—particularly BJP and INC—pouring substantial budgets into Facebook and Instagram ads. This project uncovers how that spending was distributed across states and whether it correlated with voter turnout.

**What’s Inside**

**Datasets**

**Advertisers:** Shows which pages (parties or campaign entities) ran ads, how many, and how much they spent.

**Locations:** Reveals ad spend distribution across different regions.

**Results:** Contains voting data including total electors, votes cast, and turnout percentages.

**Analysis Workflow**

Loaded and cleaned the datasets using Python (pandas).

Standardized text fields (e.g., state and location name) before performing merges.

Explored spending patterns and compared them with voter turnout to identify trends.

**Key Questions Addressed**

Which entities were the top advertisers?

How was ad spending distributed across states?

Does higher ad spending correlate with higher voter turnout?

**Visual Insights**

Created interactive visualizations using Plotly (and optionally Tableau) to bring data patterns to life.

**How to Use This Repository**

Download the CSV datasets: advertisers.csv, locations.csv, results.csv.

Follow the Jupyter notebooks to perform data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Explore the charts to see where ads were focused and how this aligns with voter turnout.

**Why It Matters**

Understanding digital campaign footprints is critical in today's era of social media-driven politics. This analysis adds transparency to the ad spending landscape and helps assess whether advertising budgets are influencing voter behavior—or simply reinforcing existing biases.
